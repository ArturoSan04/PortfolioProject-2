This project is based on sample data and questions that a hotel's stakeholders had on the progress over a couple of years
The questions that the stakeholders had are listed below:

-- Is our hotel revenue growing by year?

-- Should we increase our parking lot size?

-- What trends can we see in the data? 

Once the data was filtered and cleaned, the data was used to make data visualizations using PowerBI. 

In this repository, you will see the syntax used to transfer over to PowerBI to create these visualizations.
